# Programming with Bitcoin Core and Lightning
## (Or: Programming Bitcoind and Lightningd)

_This is a tutorial for working with Bitcoin (and Lightning) that teaches direct interact with the severs themselves, as the most robust and secure way to begin cryptocurrency work._

> NOTE: This is a draft in progress, so that I can get some feedback from early reviewers. It is not yet ready for use.

## Introduction

The best way to learn deeply about bitcoin is to avoid GUIs (even bitcoin-qt), and instead learn it from the command line.

## Requirements

This tutorial assumes that you have some minimal background of how to use the command line interface. If not, there are many tutorials available, and I have one for Mac users at https://github.com/ChristopherA/intro-mac-command-line

**PART FOUR: LIGHTNING-CLI**

_This section is unwritten currently, and will probably involve chapter 14.0 expanding into at least two chapters._

* 12.0: Setting Up TOR
* 13.0: Setting Up Lightning
* 14.0: Using Lightning

**PART FIVE: BITCOIN & LIGHTNING PROGRAMMING**

_This section is currently a messy set of older writings which are being reorganized as listed below. We're not going to work through this section until we've got chapters 1-11 updated per our current notes, then 12-14 written. But, if you'd like to see what we have to date on programming in correlation with Bitcoin Core, please feel free._
